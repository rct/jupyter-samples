# Jupyter Sample Notebooks

A collection of sample [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks and probably just some links to good collections/sources of information. My goal is to have some easy to find cheatsheets for myself and possibly others to use.

Most of what's in here will be [IPython](https://ipython.org/).

## Prerequisites for running Jupyter (someplace)

Just a short list of the useful links. 

## Running Jupyter in the cloud, SaaS, etc.

How to run Jupyter in non-traditional places, the clood, Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) or SaaS.
