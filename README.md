# Jupyter Sample Notebooks

A collection of sample [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks and probably just some links to good collections/sources of information. My goal is to have some easy to find cheatsheets for myself and possibly others to use.

Most of what's in here will be [IPython](https://ipython.org/).

One of the reasons I'm doing this is because I think it is so cool that github renders Jupyter notebooks very nicely.  So many possibilities, so little time.

## Prerequisites for running Jupyter (someplace)

Just a short list of the useful links. 

## Running Jupyter in the cloud, SaaS, etc.

How to run Jupyter in non-traditional places, the clood, Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) or SaaS.

# The Notebooks

## Intro, overview, stand-alone demo

* [Pandas Daily Stock Closing Price Graph using Yahoo Finance](https://github.com/rct/jupyter-samples/blob/master/Pandas_Stock_Closing_Price_Example.ipynb] - Great demo found on [GetWarped's](https://github.com/getwarped/jupyter-notebooks) repo. Just a few lines to suck data from Yahoo finance into Pandas and graph it.
* [Wind spped and direction calculation using complex numbers from Michael Ossmann](https://github.com/rct/jupyter-samples/blob/master/Jupyter_Wind_Speed_and_Direction_Vector_Example_from_mossmann.ipynb) - Calculate average wind speed and direction vector using complex numbers. From Michael Ossman's excellent [Intro to SDR with HackRF](http://greatscottgadgets.com/sdr/) on-line tutorial.
* [IPython Examples - Rich Output](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ipython/ipython/blob/master/examples/IPython%20Kernel/Rich%20Output.ipynb) - Lots to try here. 
* TODO - Rich output examples that visualize and play audio.
  * Like the example on the IPython page that graphs an audio file into scope and FFT. 
  * [ipython_audio from musicinformationretrieval.com][http://musicinformationretrieval.com/ipython_audio.html - some good stuff here, though some parts use librosa which isn't currently available via Anaconda.
